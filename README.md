# SimpleCode Documentation

SimpleCode is a pseudocode language designed to streamline the understanding and learning of programming concepts. It follows a more conversational English syntax to make it easier for beginners to grasp fundamental programming structures. SimpleCode is not a runnable programming language, but rather a language to help illustrate how actual programming works.

Here are some key features of SimpleCode:

1. **Intuitive Syntax**: SimpleCode is designed with a syntax that is easy to read and write. It aims to closely resemble natural English language as much as possible, making it more accessible for non-programmers or beginners.

2. **Variables**: SimpleCode supports variable declaration and reassignment, providing a clear way to demonstrate how data can be stored and manipulated in code.

3. **Arithmetic Operations**: The language supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. **Control Structures**: SimpleCode demonstrates the basics of control flow in programming, including conditional logic and loops.

5. **Functions**: The language allows for the declaration and calling of functions, demonstrating the concept of reusable blocks of code.

6. **Lists and Iteration**: SimpleCode supports the creation of lists (arrays) and the iteration over these lists, introducing the concept of data structures and data manipulation.

7. **Code Blocks**: SimpleCode introduces the concept of distinct blocks of code, enabling the organization of related code into sections for better readability and structure.

8. **Returning**: It also introduces the idea of returning a value from a function.

SimpleCode is a powerful tool for beginners looking to understand programming concepts, teachers looking for a simplified way to explain coding, and for those who need to quickly draft or understand algorithms in a readable, intuitive syntax.

## Basics

**Declare a Variable and Assign a Value**

`Create a variable named (variable name) with a value of (value)`

Example: `Create a variable named count with a value of 0`

**Change the Value of a Variable**

`Change the value of (variable name) to (value)`

Example: `Change the value of count to 10`

## Arithmetic Operations

**Add Two Values**

`Add (value1) and (value2)`

Example: `Add 2 and 3`

**Subtract One Value from Another**

`Subtract (value2) from (value1)`

Example: `Subtract 3 from 5`

**Multiply Two Values**

`Multiply (value1) by (value2)`

Example: `Multiply 2 by 3`

**Divide One Value by Another**

`Divide (value1) by (value2)`

Example: `Divide 6 by 3`

## Control Structures

**Repeat an Action**

`Perform (action) (number) times`

Example: `Perform "Change the value of count to Add count and 1" 5 times`

**Conditional Actions**

`If (condition), then do (action)`

Example: `If count is more than 5, then do "Change the value of count to 5"`

**Alternative Action**

`If not, then do (action)`

Example: `If not, then do "Change the value of count to 0"`

## Functions

**Create a Function**

`Define a process called (function name) that does (actions)`

Example: `Define a process called increment that does "Change the value of count to Add count and 1"`

**Use a Function**

`Carry out the process (function name)`

Example: `Carry out the process increment`

## Lists and Iteration

**Create a List**

`Make a list named (list name) with items (items)`

Example: `Make a list named numbers with items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

**Iterate Over a List**

`For each item in (list), do (action)`

Example: `For each item in numbers, do "Carry out the process increment"`

## Returning

**Return a Value from a Function**

`The result is (value)`

Example: `The result is count`

This version of SimpleCode uses traditional math operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for arithmetic operations.
